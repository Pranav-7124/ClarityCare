## 💰 Financial Protection Demo

### **Option 1: HDFC ERGO Example (Recommended for First Demo)**

1. Click **"Decode Insurance Policy"** button
2. Click **"HDFC Example"** button
3. Watch the analysis process (takes ~1 second)
4. **Explain the results:**

**Key Points to Highlight:**

- ✅ **Room Rent Analysis:** "Notice how it clearly shows 1% limit with real-world examples -
  ₹5,000/day for ₹5 lakh coverage"
- ⚠️ **Co-payment Clarity:** "10% co-pay for seniors 60+ is clearly highlighted with cost examples"
- 🚨 **Hidden Clauses Exposed:** "Pre-authorization needed 48 hours before surgery - many people miss
  this!"
- 💡 **Actionable Recommendations:** "See the critical warnings with emojis for easy scanning"

**Demo Script:**
> "Let me show you how ClarityCare decodes complex insurance policies. I'll use an HDFC ERGO policy
as an example. *[Click buttons]* Within seconds, the AI has extracted all critical information:
>
> - Room rent limits that many patients exceed unknowingly
> - Co-payment requirements that create surprise bills
> - Hidden clauses about pre-authorization that can lead to claim rejection
> - And most importantly, actionable recommendations to maximize your coverage"

### **Option 2: Star Health Example (Show Advanced Features)**

1. Click **"Star Health Example"** button
2. Point out **different terms:**
    - Higher room rent limit (1.5% vs 1%)
    - Higher senior co-payment (20% vs 10%)
    - Cumulative co-payments (35% if senior + non-network)

**Demo Script:**
> "Different insurers have vastly different terms. Star Health, for example, has 20% co-payment for
seniors above 65. If you go to a non-network hospital, that's another 15% - totaling 35%! That's
₹70,000 out-of-pocket on a ₹2 lakh surgery. ClarityCare makes these differences crystal clear."

>
> First, it clarifies: URGENT but not emergency - you have 3-5 days for proper evaluation.
